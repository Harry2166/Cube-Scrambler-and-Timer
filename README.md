# Cube-Scrambler-and-Timer
A Rubik's Cube scrambler and timer made in Python.

This is the first project by Harry2166.

For those without experience in using or solving a Rubik's Cube, refer to the following link:

This code has three functions:
- To give a scramble for the Rubik's Cube
- To have a timer for the Rubik's Cube
- To store the times in a separate .txt file

In order to give the scramble of the cube, there were three lists that contains the three different types of rotation or moves (as specified in the code), the clockwise, counterclockwise, and double turn.

There is a random number generator that was used in order to determine which type of rotation would be used, with each type of rotation being assigned with a certain number.

*This is my first project that I've done and posted here in GitHub, it isn't the best and I know it can be improved but it's worth posting here!*
